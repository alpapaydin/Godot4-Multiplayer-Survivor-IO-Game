## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Godot Engine 4.x](https://godotengine.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SurvivorIO.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```sh
	cd SurvivorIO
	```

### Running the Game

1. Set the server IP:
	- Open `Constants.gd` autoload and set `DEFAULT_SERVER_IP` to `"localhost"` for local testing.
	```gdscript
	var DEFAULT_SERVER_IP = "localhost"
	```
2. Start the server from the Godot editor. Server is designed to be a headless instance so it is not playable.
3. Launch the web client or another instance from the Godot editor to automatically connect to server.

### Deployment

1. If you want to upload to your server or itch.io, you need to use `wss`:
	- Generate Let's Encrypt certificates.
	- Place them in the `assets/certs` folder.
	- Set host info and cert paths in `Constants.gd`, and `USE_SSL` to `true`.
	- The clients will automatically connect to the server using these certificates.

2. You can use predefined export templates for linux server and web client.
